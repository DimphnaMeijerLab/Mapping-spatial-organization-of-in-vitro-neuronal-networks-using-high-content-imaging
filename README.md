# Mapping-spatial-organization-of-in-vitro-neuronal-networks-using-high-content-imaging
Here we collect all the scripts use in: Mapping spatial organization of in vitro neuronal networks using high-content imaging. These scripts allow the analysis of complete neuronal network in vitro. The folder contain four folders, and each folder contains main and functions used in the analysis. 
1. Analysis: here you can find the MATLAB scripts for the analysis of the stiched wells. The framework called Modular Image Analysis (MIA). MIA is divided into modules and uses parallel programming to analyze multiple wells simultaneously. The Nuclei Analysis module was used to differentiate between neuronal and non-neuronal cells. The Distance Analysis module performed a spatial analysis of the distribution of cells in the wells.
